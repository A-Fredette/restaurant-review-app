# Project for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree
---

## Summary
This is a mobile-friendly, responsive restaurant review app. This app was built with an offline-first mentality, and has caching via service worker enabled and incorporates the Google Map API.

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.
