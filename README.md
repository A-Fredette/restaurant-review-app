# Project for Udacity's Front End Nanodegree
---

## Summary
This is a mobile-friendly, responsive restaurant review app. This app was built with an offline-first mentality, and has caching via service worker enabled and incorporates the Google Map API.

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## Installation
1. Clone the GitHub repository or download the files as a .zip. 
2. From the root, launch a simple python server (python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000).
3. Navigation to http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser.
